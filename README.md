# Welcome to my Vue.js and Auth0 dummy project here I have implemented  Auth0 into a Vue 3 project to allow users to authenticated and get authorization to view the Private tab which will display there local time. Below are the run instructions. The configuration to the Auth0 web aplication is hardcoded in to the auth.js file to avoid having to setup a .env for faster demo purposes.
